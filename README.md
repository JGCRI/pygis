# pygis
Python-based Geographic Information System (GIS) utilities

## Description
The `pygis` package facilitates GIS functionality and workflows commonly represented in proprietary and open source GISs. This package does not contain functionality for visualization, but is focused on geospatial algorithms for analysis, conversion, IO, modification, and workflows of spatial files and data structures.

## Get started with `pygis`
Some `pygis` modules require GEOS (https://grst.github.io/geos/users.html).  Mac users who have installed
Python using homebrew will likely need to install GEOS using brew as well.

1. Clone `pygis` into your desired location `git clone https://github.com/JGCRI/pygis.git`
2. From the directory you cloned `pygis` into run `python setup.py install`
3. Examples are provided in a Jupyter notebook in the `pygis` root directory
